        What is a family hub? 
      </h1>

      <p>Family hubs bring together local services in one place for families.</p>  
      <p>Family hubs offer a wide range of services for the whole family, including:</p>   

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>babies</li>
        <li>children</li>
        <li>teenagers</li>
        <li>parents and carers</li>
        <li>children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities up to age 25</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
        What do family hubs offer? 
      </h2>
      <p>Each hub or children’s centre offers a different range of services and activities, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>breastfeeding support</li>
        <li>child development clinics</li>
        <li>parenting workshops</li>
        <li>mental health help </li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">
        Where are family hubs?
      </h2>
      <p>There is normally a base for a family hub or children’s centre. 
        Some services may run from different locations, like libraries or health clinics.
      </p>

      <p>There are family hubs all over England, run by local councils. 
        You can search here to find family hubs near you, or children’s centres, which may offer similar services.
